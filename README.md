## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Software Engineering-focused Computer Science undergraduate specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at VIT Chennai.

My primary focus is building scalable backend systems using strong software engineering fundamentals — Data Structures & Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, and modular architecture design.

Alongside core SWE, I work on applied AI systems, intelligent agents, and data-driven solutions with real-world deployment experience.
